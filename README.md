# NodeJS-Based Chrome Extension Development

This repository contains the source code for a NodeJS-based Chrome extension. The extension allows users to perform certain actions in the browser, such as navigating to specific URLs or running custom JavaScript code, through a simple user interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Chrome extension, you will need to have NodeJS and NPM installed on your local machine. You can download the latest versions of both from the official NodeJS website.

Once you have NodeJS and NPM installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can build the extension using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the compiled extension code.

## Running Locally

To test the extension locally in your Chrome browser, you will need to first enable developer mode in Chrome. To do this, navigate to the Extensions page in Chrome by typing `chrome://extensions` into the address bar, then toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner.

Next, click the "Load unpacked" button and navigate to the `dist` folder that was generated by the `npm run build` command. Select the folder and click "Open" to load the extension into Chrome.

You should now see the extension icon in your browser toolbar. Click the icon to open the extension popup, where you can perform various actions and test the functionality of the extension.

## Deployment

To deploy the extension to the Chrome Web Store, you will need to first create a developer account and package the extension into a `.zip` file. You can then upload the `.zip` file to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard, where it will undergo a review process before being published to the Chrome Web Store.

For more information on publishing Chrome extensions, please refer to the official Chrome Web Store documentation.
